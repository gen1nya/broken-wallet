# Broken Wallet

Experimental web-based wallet playground built with React, Vite, TypeScript, and Chakra UI. The goal is to demo key management and signing flows without rolling custom cryptography (we will rely on vetted libraries like `ethers`).

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the Vite development server.
- `npm run build` – type-check and build for production.
- `npm run preview` – preview the production build locally.
- `npm run lint` – run ESLint with the flat configuration.
